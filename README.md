# Github Searcher
This is a simple search tool that allows the users to search the users or repositories or issues on GitHub.

## Get Started
to run the project you should follow the below steps:
* Install the dependencies by running the following command (be sure that you are in the root directory of the project)
#### `yarn` or `npm install`
* after installing the dependencies, you need to run the development server by running this command
#### `yarn start` or `npm start`
there are some other available commands:

*  `yarn test` or `npm test` to run tests (we don't have tests yet, but we will add it later)

*  `yarn build` or `npm build` to build the app for the production

*  `yarn eject` or `npm eject` you can read more about this command [here](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/available-scripts/#npm-run-eject)
